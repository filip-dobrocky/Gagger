If the picture is loaded and there's still a loading icon visible, it means the app is checking if the image is a GIF or not.
When there's a GIF icon is visible, it means you can load and play the GIF by clicking on the image. You can pause playing GIF animations
 by clicking on them.<br><br>
<b>Zooming images</b><br>
You can open an image (that isn't a GIF) in full size by clicking on it. You can zoom using the toolbar buttons or by double-clicking on the image.
The 'pinch to zoom' feature is yet to be implemented.<br><br>
<b>Refreshing</b><br>
You can click 'Refresh' in the toolbar to refresh either posts, or comments.<br><br>
<b>Opening posts via 9gag</b><br>
This app does not support voting, commenting or uploading. So if you want to do any of these things, you'll have to long-press the image you want to open
 and click 'Open post via 9gag.com'."
